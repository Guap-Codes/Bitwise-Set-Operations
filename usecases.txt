* Additional use cases for other functions in the SetOperations contract:


The functions shiftLeftUnion, shiftRightIntersection, rotateLeftDifference, and rotateRightSymmetricDifference are specialized bitwise operations that can be useful in various scenarios, particularly in low-level programming, cryptography, and data manipulation. Here are some potential use cases for each function:

- shiftLeftUnion:
Data Encoding: When encoding data, you might need to shift bits to the left to make space for new data and then combine it with existing data.
Bitmask Manipulation: Useful in scenarios where you need to shift a bitmask to the left and then combine it with another bitmask to create a new set of flags or permissions.

- shiftRightIntersection:
Data Filtering: When filtering data, you might need to shift bits to the right to align with a specific pattern and then find the intersection with another bitmask to extract relevant information.
Bitmask Comparison: Useful in scenarios where you need to shift a bitmask to the right and then compare it with another bitmask to find common flags or permissions.

- rotateLeftDifference:
Circular Buffer Management: In circular buffer implementations, rotating bits to the left can help manage buffer indices, and finding the difference with another bitmask can help identify available or used slots.
Cryptographic Operations: Useful in cryptographic algorithms where rotating bits and finding differences are common operations for data transformation and encryption.

- rotateRightSymmetricDifference:
Data Scrambling: When scrambling data, rotating bits to the right and finding the symmetric difference with another bitmask can help create a more complex and secure transformation.
Error Detection and Correction: Useful in error detection and correction algorithms where rotating bits and finding symmetric differences can help identify and correct errors in data transmission.
